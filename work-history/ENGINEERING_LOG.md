## 2026-08-21 - clone-orchestration-project execution start

- Approved plan: sandbox/plans/clone-orchestration-project-20260821-1819-plan.md
- Work: add ./clone-orchestration-project to clone this example into git_home/<name> with orchestration + master worktrees
- First action per STANDARD BLOCK; host has no ./build_app (phase gate: bash -n + forensic read)

## 2026-08-21 - clone-orchestration-project landed (staged)

- Added ./clone-orchestration-project (discovery, clone --no-hardlinks as primary, orchestration+master worktrees, fix-perms --skip-sudoers)
- README.md + project-facts.md document the helper
- Verified: bash -n; --dry-run SomeName from this tree, git_home, and --source (same source/dest)
- git commit blocked: ai-orchestrator has no user.name/email (changes remain staged)

## 2026-08-21 - clone-seed-worktree-config execution start

- Approved plan: sandbox/plans/clone-seed-worktree-config-20260821-1840-plan.md
- Work: seed dest+master project.config via ve_seed_worktree_project_config; dest-root DAC 2775; --repair; repair torque-ford-gas-tracking
- First action per STANDARD BLOCK; host has no ./build_app

## 2026-08-21 - clone-seed-worktree-config script landed; live --repair blocked

- clone-orchestration-project now seeds dest+master project.config via ve_seed_worktree_project_config, dest-root chown 2775, and --repair
- Live --repair of torque-ford-gas-tracking failed in this session: dest is 770 dlang:dlang and sudo is blocked (Landlock no-new-privileges)
- Human: run as dlang ./clone-orchestration-project --repair /home/dlang/git/torque-ford-gas-tracking

## 2026-08-21 - clone-landlock-exec-dac execution start

- Approved plan: sandbox/plans/clone-landlock-exec-dac-20260821-1901-plan.md
- Work: fix-perms lists agent-landlock+env; clone do_fix_perms uses this tree fix-perms with explicit DEST and DEST/master; force landlock 775
- First action per STANDARD BLOCK; host has no ./build_app

## 2026-08-21 - clone-landlock-exec-dac landed

- fix-perms: agent-landlock and env in executable-scripts list (2775/775 o+x)
- clone-orchestration-project: this-tree fix-perms --skip-sudoers DEST and DEST/master; force landlock 775
- Live dest not repaired from this session (sudo/Landlock nnp). Human: --repair torque-ford-gas-tracking as dlang

## 2026-11-12 - libpin kit 2026.10.24

- Synced the libpin kit (fetch-deps, get-artifacts, VERSION, libpin-sandbox, libpin-bwrap, libpin-landlock) from orchestration-example@830b09e (libpin@1a98c91, LIBPIN_VERSION 2026.10.24).
- .gitignore un-ignores third_party/VERSION (and the other kit tools where they were still ignored).
- Pin tomls updated as needed for the new kit (example: source_kind=seed-src, default=false, sha256; heavy pins rclone/paddle/paddle-opt/opencv: default=false).
